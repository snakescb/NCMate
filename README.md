# NCMate
Motion controller hardware - Inspired by the awesome FluidNC CNC control firmware - [FluidNC](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC)

## Get your NCMate
- You can download gerber files from Github and produce the PCB on your own.
- I always try to have some assembled boards on stock. Price for an NCMate-4 is USD 80 plus shipping, NCMate-Compact is not available for purchase yet. I sell the boards with no warranty, as this is a non-profit opensource project. If you are interested, contact me on luethich80@gmail.com.
- NCMate is designed in EasyEDA and shared (Link below in the versions). You can clone the EasyEDA project, make changes as you like and order the PCB on your own. All designs are using parts which are normally in stock for assembly at JLCPCB, so you can order your board directly from EasyEDA including assembly if desired.

### Versions and know issues
**Version 2.0**
- Changes
  - New size 80x105mm - almost 50% smaller than previous versions
  - Changed to smaller 3.81mm pluggable terminal blocks
  - Full pinout documented on PCB for easy setup
  - Added possibility for SD Card detect pin
  - ESC conector removed, spindle ESC can be driven by RC output
  - Increased input voltage on main DC/DC convertor to accept 48 Volt
- Known Issues
  - No known issues
  - 
**Version 1.4**
- Changes
  - 5V DC/DC converter fixed
  - 5V DC/DC output voltage changed to 4.9V
  - Added esp32 reset curcuitry for easy esptool.py programming
  - Changed passthrough - Enable signal can be passed to motor connectors now.
- Known Issues
  - No known issues
    
**Version 1.3**
- Changes
  - First public version
- Known Issues
  - 5V DC/DC Converter hooked up incorrectly. Produces 7.5V output voltage which breaks the digital isolators. 
  - No esptool.py reset circuitry makes programming cumbersome

## NCMate-Compact
Compact and simplified NCMate with 4 builtin TMC2160 drivers with external Mosfets. With some 3D printed frameparts, a housing made from PCB (or 3D printed) and a builtin cooling solution for drivers. Having 3/4 axis milling machines but also 3D printers in mind, this version also includes inputs for 2 PT1000 temperature sensors up to 400 degrees.

Currently in the making

- 4 outputs for RC Servos, can be confgured as additional independant axes in FluidNC
- 2 inputs for PT1000 temperature elements with signal conditioning for 0-400Â° (inputs shared with 2 RC outputs)
- 4 digital 5V outputs (non-isolated)
- 6 digital 5V inputs (non-isolated), for limit switches, probe sensors and others
- 1 UART/I2C extension port for future addons
- 1 fan connectors, pwm controlled, 5V
- Onboard ESP32 WROOM 32 module with 16MB onboard flash, wifi or bluetooth enabled by firmware
- 12-24V input
